#Apple M0110 BT PCB
===================

A prototype replacement pcb for the Apple M0110 keyboard. 

This pcb uses the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE or a Teensy 2.0 controller to 
send keycodes to the connected computer.

###Parts list 
=============

1. Teensy 2.0 x 1
2. Your favorite MX style switches x 60
3. 1N4148 switch diodes x 60

If you're going the bluetooth route you will need the following additional items: 
1. GPIO Expander (MCP23017-E/SP-ND) x 1
2. Lithium Ion battery x 1.  I chose the biggest I could find on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0137IPVY6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that fit inside the original Apple M0110 case.
3. Adafruit Bluefruit 32u4 module instead of the Teensy
4. 4.7k Ohm Resistors x4

###Build Instructions
